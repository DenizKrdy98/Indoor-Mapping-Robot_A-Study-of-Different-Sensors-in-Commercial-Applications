# Indoor-Mapping-Robot_A-Study-of-Different-Sensors-in-Commercial-Applications

In this project, the main goal is to do a detailed study of different distance measurement sensors that are used or can be used in indoor mapping applications for commercial use. The preference of the market is dominated by expensive sensors that drives the final product prices dramatically up. This focused study based on an actualized Indoor Mapping Application in which different alternative distance sensors are used will provide a unique perspective to designers to have alternative approaches.  

Used and Compared Sensor Types:
- Infrared Distance Sensor
- Laser Range Finder
- Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
- LiDAR (A Low-Priced One)

Methodologies:
- Designing and Mounting a Setup Consisting of Arduino, DC motors, Distance Sensors, Communication Modules etc.
- Localization and Position Detection (Odometry)​
- Automated Movement Algorithm of Scanning Robot
- Mapping Algorithm Development: Combination of Odometrical and Distance Data​
- Visualization of the Mapping Results (Real-time Graphics)​
